  abstract={We report sub-nanosecond switching of a metal–oxide–metal memristor utilizing a broadband 20 GHz experimental setup developed to observe fast switching dynamics. Set and reset operations were successfully performed in the tantalum oxide memristor using pulses with durations of 105 and 120 ps, respectively. Reproducibility of the sub-nanosecond switching was also confirmed as the device switched over consecutive cycles.}

This article discusses the advantages CIM(computing in memory) architecture using memristors has over CMOS(Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) architecture.  It provides straightforward information relating to energy efficiency improvements as well as computational improvements.

Performance and energy models for memristor-based 1T1R RRAM cell

Primary source/depending on how in depth description of memristor/read/write will be
 
The publication of this article looks much more promising than the publication of the previous article which seems to cover the same topic.  This paper covers what is likely one of the more important implementations of memristor/RRAM and models for the read and write time/energy for this architecture.  These might be a bit too mathy to include though as it's beginning to encroach into electrical engineering territory which might not be suitable for CSci.  It is also quite complex looking and takes up a significant portion of the paper so it might not be ideal to include it.

The Missing Memristor Has Not Been Found
Authors: Sascha Vongehr & Xiangkang Meng
2015
This article should hopefully clear up some confusion on what exactly it was that HP created in 2008 that is being called a memristor.  However is also adds its own confusion as it is dealing with information that large amounts of researchers managed to overlook, so it is not the easiest to understand.  It does not appear to be from a conference.
